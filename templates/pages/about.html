        <h2>We Search For The Perfect Home</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          At BT Real Estate, we believe that when it comes to finding a home
          what's outside the front door is just as important as what's behind
          it.

        <p class="mt-4">
          BT Real Estate goes beyond typical listings, to give people a deeper
          understanding of what living in a home and neighborhood is really
          like. We're committed to helping them discover a place where they will
          love to live and where they will feel more connected to the community
          and to each other. It's why we strive every day to help build a more
          neighborly world.
